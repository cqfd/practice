/* Exercise 1-18. Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each
 * line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines.
 *
 * Notes.
 * - Deletes blank lines.
 * - Removes leading white space.
 * - Prints non-whitespace characters immediately.
 * - Buffers up to MAXWS (non-leading) whitespace characters; prints them if
 *   they are followed by a non-whitespace character before the buffer is full,
 *   truncates otherwise.
 * - Depends upon consecutive input (consecutive whitespace), independent of
 *   line length.
